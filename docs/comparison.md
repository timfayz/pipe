# Comparison

This document is intended for people who already know programming and want to take a "taste" how different problems can be solved by pipe comparing to other the most popular languages. The examples do not pretend to be the most ideomatic and optimal solution for a given task. 

If you want to add new language or suggest an improvement, you are very welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/timfayz/pipe-lang/issues).
